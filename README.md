This repository contains a working YOLOv8 inference pipeline (using Ultralytics), a scoring engine, and a simple Flask web dashboard that lets you upload a match video, 
runs inference to detect & track robots, and produces an annotated output video and a scoreboard.

If the webapp fails to work, paste   python -m src.inference.run_tracking --video assets/sample_videos/TrainingVideo1.mp4   into the vscode terminal

This is my Final for CS351 Intro to AI Systems.
