FRCScorekeeper

This repository contains a working YOLOv8 inference pipeline (using Ultralytics), a scoring engine, and a simple Flask web dashboard that lets you upload a match video, 
runs inference to detect & track robots, and produces an annotated output video and a scoreboard.

This is my Final for CS351 Intro to AI Systems.
